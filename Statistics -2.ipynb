    "Ans - The mean is the average of all the values in the dataset. It is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers or extreme values in the dataset, which can make it higher or lower than the true centre of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. It is calculated by sorting the values from lowest to highest and finding the value that splits the dataset in half. If there are an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two values. The median is not affected by outliers or extreme values, so it can be a better measure of central tendency for skewed or non-normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the most frequent value in the dataset. It is calculated by counting how many times each value occurs and finding the value that occurs most often. There can be more than one mode or no mode at all, depending on how many values have the same frequency. The mode can be used for any type of data, including categorical or nominal data, such as colors, names, or labels."

    "##### Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in  statistical analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Covariance and correlation are two ways to measure how two variables change together. Covariance shows the direction of the relationship, while correlation shows the direction and the strength of the relationship. These measures are used in statistical analysis to test hypotheses, compare results, and check assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance and correlation can also be used to assess the validity of regression models, by checking the assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity."

    "\n",
    "1. Measures of central tendency, such as the mean, the median, and the mode, are used to describe the typical or representative value of a data set. Outliers can affect these measures by pulling them towards the direction of the outlier, making them less representative of the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a data set of 10 salaries: 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 500 (in thousands), the mean salary is 104, which is influenced by the outlier of 500. The median salary is 62.5, which is less affected by the outlier. The mode salary is not affected by the outlier, as it is the most frequent value in the data (there is no mode in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measures of dispersion, such as the range, the variance, and the standard deviation, are used to describe how spread out or variable the data are. Outliers can affect these measures by increasing them, making them reflect more variability than there actually is in the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using the same data set of salaries as above, the range is 460 (500 - 40), which is influenced by the outlier of 500. The variance is 18136, which is also influenced by the outlier. The standard deviation is 134.67, which is also affected by the outlier."
